What set of tools would you use with the cluster to make it production environment
ready? Why would you use them and what would be the benefit from using these
specific tools?

- AWS Account, with access (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key is necessary).
- Terraform CLI.
Why? Because it is an open source tool. It is an automated way of building infrastructure (Infrastructure as a Code tool), more secure, scalable and easy to maintain. A plan is build, of what we want to execute, and then Terraform creates the resources for us.
- A terminal to run Terraform CLI
